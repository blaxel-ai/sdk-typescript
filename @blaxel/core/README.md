## Installation

Install Blaxel core SDK, which lets you manage Blaxel resources.

```bash
## npm
npm install @blaxel/core

## pnpm
pnpm i @blaxel/core

## yarn
yarn add @blaxel/core
```


### Optional libraries
Blaxel SDK is split between multiple packages. *core* is the minimal package to connect to Blaxel. You can find other packages to help you integrate with your favorite AI framework, or set up telemetry.

- [@blaxel/telemetry](@blaxel/telemetry/README.md)
- [@blaxel/vercel](@blaxel/vercel/README.md)
- [@blaxel/llamaindex](@blaxel/llamaindex/README.md)
- [@blaxel/langgraph](@blaxel/langgraph/README.md)
- [@blaxel/mastra](@blaxel/mastra/README.md)

Instrumentation happens automatically when workloads run on Blaxel. To enable telemetry, simply require the SDK in your project's entry point.
```ts
import "@blaxel/telemetry";
```


### Authentication

The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:
1. When running on Blaxel, authentication is handled automatically
2. Variables in your .env file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options).
3. Environment variables from your machine
4. Configuration file created locally when you log in through Blaxel CLI (or deploy on Blaxel)

When developing locally, the recommended method is to just log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI. This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the third option above.

## Quickstart

Blaxel CLI gives you a quick way to create new applications: agents, MCP servers, jobs, etc - and deploy them to Blaxel.

**Prerequisites**:
- **Node.js:** v18 or later.
- **Blaxel CLI:** Make sure you have Blaxel CLI installed. If not, [install it](https://docs.blaxel.ai/cli-reference/introduction):
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \
  | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
  ```
- **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel:
  ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
  ```

```bash
bl create-agent-app myfolder
cd myfolder
bl deploy
```

Also available:
-  `bl create-mcp-server`
-  `bl create-job`
